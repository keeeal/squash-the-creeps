# Squash the creeps

[![tests](https://github.com/keeeal/squash-the-creeps/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/keeeal/squash-the-creeps/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)

This is my implementation of [Godot's 3D tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html#) in Rust. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

### Setup

This repo assumes that you have Godot 4 installed and available either:

- in your `PATH` as `godot4`,
- or an environment variable called `GODOT4_BIN`, containing the path to the Godot executable.

### Usage

To build the project:

```
make build
```

Then to run the game:

```
make run
```
